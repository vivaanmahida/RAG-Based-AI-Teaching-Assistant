  "text": " In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening open with code by right-clicking and shifting. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some other attributes which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here like this. So if you have video.mp4, it will play. I have video.mp4. So let's see here. I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Okay, now it's a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px. I will only do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. Here too we will not need to write px. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing. I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller. I make it 255. And you see it came here. Okay, now I play it because I have put control. I can play it. What did you say? What name did you say? Where did you go in the US? I have gone to many places in the US. Tell me the name. So what is it that you can play the video like this. Now here are some attributes of the video tag. See, it is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can do mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand that if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else. So I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can be on your server. It can also come from the third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the video of Bhupendra Jogi. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what the control ads will be in your video. What will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. So if I put autoplay here. Suppose I put autoplay here. Okay. See what is happening here. So you can see that it is autoplay here. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will loop. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something like downloading VS Code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want when I record a video. If there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will make a video by scrolling like this. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute in your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here, poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you see, it will look something like this. This is how the poster looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video. This is exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. You know that the width and height specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. Okay. So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very fun quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio, src comes here. And I have to put src in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put src is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls, I won't see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. Sachin, what is in sachin? It's a bad sachin. Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it, it won't work. And I can also increase it further. It's a bad sachin. Okay. You people have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That we will see some attributes of this audio. You know src. Source of the video file. Okay. Then after this, you know the controls. Play, pause and volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will automatically play it. If I have here. Autoplay. Sachin, what is in sachin? It will automatically play it. It's a bad sachin. Okay. So what does autoplay do? It automatically plays our audio. After this. The next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it. So I have autoplayed it. Now I will loop it. Sachin, what is in sachin? It's a bad sachin. Once. Sachin, what is in sachin? Second time. It's a bad sachin. So you saw it was repeated. Means it was played once. Then it was played again. Because it is looped. So you saw this thing. Sachin.mp3 looped. Means it was played once. Then it was played. Then it was played. Sachin, what is in sachin? It was repeated. Because this mp3. Will be played again and again. So there are many cases. When you want. This mp3 to be repeated. Okay. So if you want. Your mp3 to be repeated. Then you can use it. Now after this. Muted. What will it do? It will mute the audio. And definitely. You will hear. The sound. It will be muted. So you can hear. The sound. So you can hear. So you can hear. So you can hear. And definitely. You don't want. By default. Your audio to be muted. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we want. That. The audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. Brother, whoever wants to hear. Unmute. Sachin, what is it? When do we do this? Which are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios at once. You can mute them. Your user can play. Unmute. And see. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. All in all. This is the thing. I hope you enjoyed it. Now preload. The most confusing. Attribute. And that's why I have. Explained it on codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not. Preload the audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. That the browser fetches the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise. You will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. Default value. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser. Will not fetch the data. Okay. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser. Only the metadata. That is. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. It will load it from the beginning. And what will happen by doing auto. That the browser. Will preload the entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do. Then it will download. And automatically. Will be loaded. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This preload attribute is asked a lot. So you should know. That what is the preload attribute. Before moving forward. I want you to. Share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you is. That you like this video. And along with that. As you are forking this repository. You should also star it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was. About audio and video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. And you should definitely use it. I will give you all the images. So that you can. Understand it. Okay. So. I am signing off. I am signing off. I am signing off. I have a lot to do. I have to make videos. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Infact. Videos also come in replit. Next topic is. SVG. Related to media. What is SVG? SVG is a format. By which you. Can create. Images. With a lot of high graphics. Vector images. So if you copy. You can basically. Make a circle in it. You can make all this. So SVG. Is used exactly in the same way. The way. It is used. Our img tag. So see. If I will put SVG here. So this SVG will come here. So see. This circular SVG. Came here. Video. Audio. SVG. These are inline elements. That's why. We are getting to see in line. Okay. You have seen here. Now. What is here. You can save the SVG file separately. You can save the SVG file separately. Like if I write here. That. Img. SVG. And save the content of SVG. So if I. Write it as img here. And I will write. Img. SVG. So you guys see here. That I don't see it. So I will. Write it. As. SVG. So you guys see here. That I don't see it. If I write alt here. And write my. SVG. Img. So you see here. That my SVG image came like this. But I didn't get to see SVG. Why did this happen? This happened because. Because the SVG. SVG file. In. Browser. I write. And. SVG file. Whenever you want in the browser. That you see. So you. Put a declaration on top. I will show you. So I wrote here. SVG. File not showing. So. Here. So here. There is a stack overflow answer. Which will tell you. So you have to write this. I will show you. XML. Something like this. See. You have to add this. It is called namespace declaration. So this SVG. You have to add this thing. And now you guys see here. SVG is visible. So this thing is very important. And many people. In the future. Whenever you make websites. Your own. So. Will definitely get stuck in this problem. I keep getting stuck. Okay. So I am telling you. That the problem in which you will get stuck. I told you before. You have not come to the problem. I also told the problem. That the coming. And also told the solution. Next topic is iframes. Iframes is also a very simple thing. That you can embed another website. From iframes. In your website. Okay. Like if I want. That I embed this webpage. So I can do it by using. Iframes in this way. So see. I wrote iframe this. And I will copy this URL. And I will paste it here. And you guys see here. That this website. Is completely embedded. Here. In this much iframe. Okay. You definitely want. That you embed in this big iframe. But if you want. You can do it. You can do it. But if you want. You can do it. You can do it. But if you want. That it is embedded. So you can embed it in this way. I will do one thing. I will increase its height. So width is equal to. Width is written. Width is equal to. Let's say. 122. Height is equal to. 444. Okay. Assume. So see. It came like this. Okay. Now definitely. It was coming in this width. So it came in this line. But if I increase the width. Let's say. I increase the width. 322. Okay. So see. It is completely embedded here. My website. You guys see. So you can embed it here. Another use case of iframe. Is youtube video. If you want. You share the youtube video. If you click on embed here. Then it will give you. Iframe code. And you. You can start it here. In any way. If you want. If you want. Start at a particular time. Then you can do that here. The point. At which you start. And you will share it. That time comes here. I will show you. Wait. Assume. I want to start from here. Okay. Assume. The video starts from here. So what I will do. I will click on share. After clicking on share. I will start at 12.19. And I will copy it. Here is the copy button. See. And I will put it here in my code. So I will comment this iframe. And I will put it in the iframe below. Okay. I will wrap the word. So that you can see the code properly. So now what I will do. After pasting this. I. I will show you the document. See this video is embedded here. Okay. So I hope you understood this thing. And. Media in html. That's all. Pretty much. Miscellaneous. I guess you will get to see a lot of things in every topic. But pretty much. That's all about media. Audio, video, media in html. That's all. This is what you will use 95% of the times. Okay. Now I will give you a quick quiz. And your quick quiz is. Create a website. Which shows. Videos of different categories. Okay. And audios of different categories. You can use. YouTube videos. In an iframe. Using YouTube's embedding feature. Okay. What you have to do is. You have to make a website. In which you will get a lot of content. Now you use the video audio tags. And YouTube. Using this share feature. The way I did this YouTube video. You can also embed it in the same way. And make a very good website. And show me. If you want. You can give me a comment on GitHub. And with that. If you want. You can also tell me the code. You can explain. But definitely attempt this quiz. And in the comment section. Do write sigma batch. Access this playlist. And like this video. Do write sigma batch OPR. That's all for this video guys. Thank you so much guys. For watching this video. And I will see you. Next time. Thank you."
