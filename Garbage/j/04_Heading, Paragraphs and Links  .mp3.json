  "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about heading and paragraphs. Along with that, I will tell you about anchor text. If you have found this course awesome, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in getting such free courses. In this video, we will make a small project which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites in one place. You will be able to use this and this in actual. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comment quickly, Sigma batch OP. Let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, I have come inside my computer screen. And if you have not accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to GitHub.com, you will get the GitHub repo of the Sigma web course. Now I have made folders for all the videos in this and the commit is also made according to different folders. So you must access it so that you get the source code. I will also put the source code of the video in the description. So there is no problem. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So without taking much time, I will make a new folder in this folder of Sigma web dev. And I will name it video 4 because it is our fourth video. So I will make it by the name of video 4. By right-clicking, I will click on open with code so that this folder opens in our VS code. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we have always done. Index.html, main.css, style.css and with it script.js. We usually make these three files. If I write CSS, I will put it here. If I write script, I will put it here. But for now, I will write exclamation mark here and write it in the document like this. My bookmarks. So we are going to make a bookmark website and I will write code here. So you must have seen such titles. Now I will write h1 here. Now what happens with h1? You can put a heading from h1 on your web page. We talked about the basic structure. We said that it tells that it is an HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute and its value is en. That is, the content of this page is in English. It tells the search engine. Or if anyone is sitting with the link of this web page, he will know that this web page is in English. He can parse this web page accordingly. The browser will also know that your web page is in English. Now here is the head in which metadata, what is the title of the page, what CSS is linked, all these things are information. The main content is inside the body. Now there is a tag inside the body to put a heading, whose name is h1. And I am going to write my bookmarks on it. So if I write my bookmarks here, we will write it with h1 tag. And if I want to make it live here, I will click here and then I will open it in the browser. So see how my bookmarks are visible. Now why should we always use h1? Why didn't I write my bookmark directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading. And this is my first level heading. Now let's say I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One main bookmark and one secondary bookmark. So I will use h2, that is, the second level heading. So I will write here. If you have used Microsoft Word, then you will know what h1 and h2 are. But if you don't know, then I will tell you that h1 is your main level heading. And after that, the second level heading is from h2. Let's say I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. Let's say I do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. Let me do one thing. Why don't I turn on screencast mode? So what I did here is, I pressed Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. So this is replicated. This is a shortcut of VS Code. I would like to tell you one more shortcut of VS Code. If you press Alt on your keyboard, and then wherever you click, a cursor will be created. Let's say I click here, then only one cursor will come. But if I press Alt and click somewhere else, then the cursor will keep coming. Let's say I want to make all bookmarks, bookmarks code with Harry. So my bookmarks dash code with Harry. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here, then I pressed Alt. And wherever I click by pressing Alt, I will get multiple cursors there. Then whatever I type will come in multiple cursors. Wherever there are cursors, whatever I type there, it will be visible. Isn't it fun? Like it on this. So I will remove it here in this way. And you guys see, it will be updated. So this is my main heading. This is my H2. Similarly, from H1 to H2, we have heading up to H6. Like suppose you gave a main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. Then after that, you had to give some heading inside it. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give a heading up to H6. H6 is more than enough. Html has heading up to 6. You will never need H7. If we talk about practical life. And if you have to read, then you can use H6 repeatedly. Because it becomes so small after H1. That H6 will become very small for you. So you don't want it to be so small. Now what I will do here, I will replicate it with Alt Shift Down Arrow. And I will click here, I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases. Now I have put two cursors here and here. I will press backspace and make it H3. Then I will click here, I will press Alt. I will click here, I will make it H4. And I will click here, I will click here. I will make it H5. After that I will click here, I will click here. I will make it H6 here. So it is up to H6. Now what I will do, I will write here using H1. So that you know. And I will write using here at least. I will press space. I will write using. I will write H. And now my work is left here. Just by clicking 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. And you see, it is looking like this. So you know that H1 is like this. H2 is like this. H3 is so small. H4 is so small. H5 is so small. H6 is so small. And what will happen if H6 is smaller than this? This will end at some point. So H6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration of this. For example, this is my HTML tutorial. So here I have given the main heading. HTML introduction. After this I have given here what is HTML. Then I have given features of HTML. I gave this from H1. I gave this from H2. I gave this from H3. There is something in it too. Like here the term was Hypertext and Markup Language. This is heading 2. What is the main heading page? HTML introduction. After this, this is subheading. I had to give a quick exercise in this too. So I used H3 in it too. Then I came back to H2. Because it was in it. So in building the hierarchy, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used. Okay. I hope you all understood. Many people are commenting that you are starting too slow. We know this. I am making this course as a beginner course. When I tell you HTML, Then you will say that this is very easy. Then I will tell you a little CSL. Then I will say that you will keep JavaScript. Yes, it comes a little. Then I will say that you will keep Bootstrap. Yes, this too. It will happen. There is a little problem. Then I will say React. You will say what is happening. Then assume NodeJS. Then I will take things to MongoDB MySQL. Then after that, The level will go up so much. I said that we will raise the bar like anything. This is what I meant. So when we will do React, When I will make projects there, When we will do dangerous things, Then I will ask for their comment below. Tell me what is the level. So don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. So these are our headings. 6 headings which I want to keep like this. Now if we want to write a paragraph, Then you can use P tag. If you hit P enter, This paragraph will come. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to bring a dummy paragraph in VS Code through Emmet, What will you do? You will write here lorem. Assume I wrote lorem 23. And see here, Emmet abbreviation has come. This is lorem 23. It will give me 23 words. Something like this. You can wrap the word by taking view peg here. Then you will not get the horizontal scroll bar. So wrap this view word. Now see here, Lorem, Epsom, Dollar, Set. Here is a dummy text. Why do we want dummy text sometimes? Because we want to make a template. And we have to fill that template with something. Assume you are making a website, Which looks like OYO rooms. Now here, OYO, Become a member, OYO for business, Assume I don't have to write all this here. I just wrote lorem here. Now I have to write something here. So I know lorem here, I have to write 7 words. I will enter by writing lorem 7. Then I will give it to OYO people. They will do whatever they want to write. So here you use it to fill the placeholder. My plan is that We will also make popular website clones. So that you will know how things work. This is also a very popular website. If you have used their services, Then do tell me in the comment section below. Now we will see more things ahead. Like here is a paragraph. How do you have to style it? And all these things are done through CSS. Now look at the paragraph here. When I wrote lorem 23, So much text came. Now I will hit p enter here. Assume I write lorem 10 here. Only 10 words will come. And if I want to write lorem 100. My page will be too full. So I can do that too. So this lorem trick is very good. You will enjoy it. And whenever we make a clone of popular websites. Assume I make a clone of Amazon.in. I make a clone of Amazon.in. So assume I have to write something here. Now I can't see so much text here. Assume I have to write 3 words here. So I will write lorem 3. I will not think about makeup products. I will write lorem 4 here. I will write lorem 3 here. I will write lorem 2 here. And I will make a template and get it ready. And then whatever is there, It will come in my database. And I can bring my text in many different ways. Many people asked that Will this course be job ready? The answer is yes. This course is going to be job ready. Absolutely I will make you so that You can do actual industry level jobs Through the learning of this course. Now let's talk about what are the attributes in HTML? These are the attributes in HTML. Like I used the HTML tag. Lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute. We did not use any attribute in the body. We did not use any attribute in H1. We did not use any attribute in P. But I can use a style attribute in P. Which is also called inline CSS. If I make the background color red here. Okay, something like this. So its background color will be red. This is also called inline CSS. Through style attribute. So if you put style is equal to CSS. First we learned to put CSS here. But if you put style is equal to. Then you will get this background red here. Let me show you. You got this red background. I will make it teal. Or I will do this. This color is looking good. So I can also put style inline. But when you make industry level websites. We use inline styles very less. Because maintainability is less. Reusability is less. So we want to ship a small bundle on the browser. And our website is more and more optimized. That's why we avoid all these things. But inline CSS has a style tag. But here style is an attribute. P is a tag. P tag has an attribute style. Through which we can style this element. We will also learn about many other attributes. Attributes basically give an element. Enhanced functionality. Like we gave a style to this paragraph. Which was background color thistle. To give this background color. We used the style attribute. Similarly to give properties. To any tag or any element. We use these attributes. Like if we talk. We talked about link. Link colon CSS. Link has a relic attribute. Hrefic attribute. So what can we do with this attribute. We can put this CSS style sheet. Like if I say background color. I say body first. What do we need in the body? Background color. And you don't worry about it. Don't worry about how this is happening. Because all this will be told in CSS. But I am telling you. Let's say I do hot pink. Another functionality of VS Code. This ninja technique will be very useful. Here hover the mouse. And here you can choose any color you want. Around it. Like this. If I leave it. And do this. The background color of my body is this. How did you like the ninja technique? Write in the comment. I liked the ninja technique. Okay. Now here. We have come back to index.html. I can remove it if I want. If I comment it out. Then this style sheet will not be there. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. It was removed. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So it was not removed. Which is very natural. Okay. It is very normal. Here I did this style is equal to background color. Because of which its background color was visible. Now we are going to make a bookmark. We are going to make a bookmark manager. Bookmark manager.html. And I am making it a separate file. Because here I have told you different types of headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. So I will write here. Bookmark manager. Now you will say. In chrome, why are you making this bookmark manager? This is made by our hands. This will be our own child. We have made it. So you will have a different love for it. Because this is. You made it yourself. Someone made a software. You bought it from somewhere. You made a software yourself. So the software you made yourself. It's a different thing. Okay. Now here you can see. Bookmark manager code is written here. I will write h1 here. And I will write my bookmarks. Okay. I wrote my bookmarks. Now I will write h2 after this. I will write primary bookmarks here. And after this I will write secondary bookmarks from h2. Okay. In fact, if I do alt shift bottom space here. And I write here. Secondary bookmarks. So what will happen? I can put secondary bookmarks here. Now what I will do? I will write google in one paragraph. Or I write google like this. Okay. We will write it from the list. But in the coming videos I will tell you. How to use the list. For now, you understand like this. Google. Suppose I write google here. Open google. And what I will do here? I will use anchor tag. So as soon as I hit enter in a. A has a mandatory attribute. href. href means. By clicking it. Which link should it go to? So I will write href is equal to. https://www.google.com So it will go to this address. Whenever someone clicks on open google. And this open google. I will cut it. I will put it here. That is, the content of this tag. It will stay like this. And here you can see. A href is equal to. This came. Open google came. This is called anchor tag. Which helps us make links. You must have seen a lot of links like this. Now you see here. As soon as I. Bookmark manager. I will go to html. You can see here. That this way. You can see all the bookmarks. Open google. Now if I click on it. Google will open. You can see. Now you noticed one thing. When I did not click on it. Then its color was blue. Now I visited it. So its color has changed. So its color changes. When you visit it. That is, it has been converted. Into a visited link. So I know. That I have visited it. Now I tell you one more thing. That here. If we want. That it opens in the new tab. Like I am clicking on it. So it is opening in the same tab. If you want to open it in the new tab. Then you have two ways. Either you have. The wheel of your mouse. Which is. The wheel of your mouse. Which is. You can click on it. One more way. Now I tell you. If you want. If someone clicks. Then opens in the new tab. Then you can use an attribute. You can write here. That target is equal to. Underscore blank. And VS code. Suggests you. So I wrote it. By hitting two enters. Write it in notepad. Write it in any other. Cheap editor. So what happens to you. Means according to quality. Cheap. Free is also VS code. But according to quality. If you use a cheap. Cheap editor. Then target. Is equal to. Underscore blank. So I wrote it. And I wrote it. So target is equal to. Underscore blank. You have to type it all. It hurts a little. But if you. Write it in any way. And what will happen now. Now I will click on it. I am clicking. I am not clicking the mouse wheel. I am clicking. I will click. It came to the new tab. Okay. If I click the mouse wheel. Then it will open in the new tab. So I can open it this way. Now I have written a very simple. Open Google. If you want. Your favorite website. Whichever website. Your favorite. You can put it here. Okay. Good good websites. Friends. Okay. Now I will write here. If you see. www.facebook.com. And suppose I write here. Quora.com. And codewithhari.com. And after this. We put it here. Let us say. Which website should I put. Youtube.com. Let's see. Whether it came here or not. You have seen one thing. It is coming in the same line. Okay. If you want. That it does not come in one line. So what will you do. You will put them in your paragraphs. This is a very dirty way. Why am I calling it dirty. I will tell you later. But you enclose it in a paragraph. If you want. You can put it in a paragraph. You can put it in a paragraph. You can put it in a paragraph. And I will press shift. I will press the right arrow key. I will do control x. Then I will press the end key. All the cursors will go to the end. Because if you press the end key on a cursor. Then they go to the end. And after this. I will also do control. Now I have used this shortcut a lot. And many of you will be like this. What did you do. If you are a beginner. But what I simply did. That I used the functionality of VS Code. Multiple cursor functionality. I pressed alt and brought multiple cursors. And after that I used it. This is ideally a good way. To make it easy. To make it easy. To make it easy. To make it easy. To make it easy. To make it easy. And now I will write. The name of the book. I will write. Stack overflow. Wikipedia.com. Wikipedia.com has come here. And assume. Stackoverflow.com We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow. Let's capitalize Stackoverflow. And now you see here. In secondary bookmarks. Your Wikipedia. And Stackoverflow. So this has become your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager. Even better. We will learn styling from CSS. So if you see this ugly. So don't take tension. Don't say this is very ugly. It looks ugly. Don't worry about it. Because we will do styling in the coming time. We will do designing. We will talk about all those things. For now, your bookmark looks like this. Bookmark manager. Code with Harry is your title. And I also write it in H1. So both will be the same. Our title and H1. That is, our title. This will also be the same. My bookmarks. Code with Harry. Will also be written here. So this way. You can make a bookmark manager. You can actually use it. Now if you save it in this way. Like this. My bookmark manager. Is HTML. You can copy it. If you want. You can put it on your desktop. Then whenever you want to open a website. You just double click it. This will open. And you can see. This is the bookmark manager. And you can see. If you want to open a website. You just double click it. This will open. If you double click it. And it opens with VS code. Then what you have to do. You have to right click. You have to open with. You have to choose another app. And then after that. By selecting Google Chrome. Always. So like I will choose Google Chrome. And I will always do it here. So whenever I double click. It will open with Google Chrome. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. Now I have a request from you.
